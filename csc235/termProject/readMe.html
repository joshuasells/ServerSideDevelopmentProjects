5 Ws:

Who:    This application is design for anyone who has a passion for cooking, baking, personal health, organization, etc. This idea is specifically designed with my wife in mind.

What:   This application will be a simple recipe manager.
        It will also be a kitchen ingrediant inventory program. User will be able to enter in food that they have on hand and create new recipes.

When:   This project is set to be completed by the end of the course.

Where:  joshuatsells.com/termproject

Why:    My wife and I are trying to transition to a plant-based diet and want an application that will keep track of our efforts in that goal.
        We also want to eventually create an integrated habit tracker to help visualize our progress.

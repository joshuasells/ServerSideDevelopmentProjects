        The biggest problem I faced when building this application was trying to keep the code simple.
        I found myself writing a lot of javaScript to validate everything and prevent bugs from happening. If I could
        go back and do it again, which I might do, then I would change my design a bit.
      </p>
      <p>In the application, all my html buttons are being reused on the fly with javaScript. I change the attributes
        of the buttons based on what the user clicks on. Because of this, a lot of stuff can go wrong. One thing I would
        do when re designing is to have a separate button for every operation, and then display it on the page when it needs
        to be displayed. This way, there will not be all the overlap bugs that I had to keep writing new code to prevent.
      </p>
      <p>Another thing I would do I have the buttons for each table row only be visible when the user's mouse is hovering over it.
        That is another good way to prevent bugs and I think it enhances the user experience.
      </p>
      <p>This was a super fun project to make and to this date, it has taught me the most about writing code. I propably put more than
        100 hours into this.
      </p>
      <p>My personal take away is that I feel confident about my ability. I still have a long way to go, but I am beginning to 
        really belive in myself that I will be a valuable asset to a business someday.

5 Ws:

Who:    This application is design for anyone who has a passion for cooking, baking, personal health, organization, etc. This idea is specifically designed with my wife in mind.

What:   This application will be a simple recipe manager and grocery list generator.
        It will also be a kitchen ingrediant inventory program. User will be able to log in and enter the food they have on hand into the application.
        They will be able to create recipes and generate a grocery based on ingrediant needs.

When:   This project is set to be completed by the end of the course.

Where:  This project will be accessible through the internet and will require login credentials. All information will be stored in a secure database.

Why:    My wife and I are trying to transition to a plant-based diet and want an application that will keep track of our efforts in that goal.
        We also want to eventually create an integrated habit tracker to help visualize our progress.
